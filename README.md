# Gmail Inbox High-Contrast Restoration

This purely cosmetic filter list for uBlock Origin restores the high-contrast Gmail Inbox themes from pre-2022. It restores colors and sizes to their former high-contrast selves, and gets rid of the new low-contrast hard-to-read colors. Assorted other changes include restoring the Compose button color, restoring the default and high-contrast themes to their original colors, and restoring curved button radiuses to be approximately as round as they used to be.

**NOTE:** a page refresh is sometimes required when switching themes. If the colors look weird, please refresh the page.

Tested with Firefox on macos.
